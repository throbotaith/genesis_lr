## 📅 Updates

<details>
<summary>2025/03/22</summary>

- I created a [new repo based on legged_gym](https://github.com/lupinjia/legged_gym_ext), containing custom implementation of some RL control papers.

</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary>2025/02/23</summary>

- find some bugs in genesis. The environments can return nan values without knowing why (https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/issues/625), which can hinder long-time training where nan values may suddenly come out and terminates your training.

<details>
<summary>2025/02/10</summary>

- add measure_heights support, and provide a demo of exteroceptive locomotion ([go2_rough](https://github.com/lupinjia/genesis_lr/tree/main/legged_gym/envs/go2/go2_rough))

![](./test_resources//go2_rough_demo.gif)

</details>

<details>
<summary>2024/12/28</summary>

- add [wiki page](https://github.com/lupinjia/genesis_lr/wiki) for instructions

</details>

<details>
<summary>2024/12/26</summary>

- add terrain support, optional terrain type: ["plane", "heightfield"].

- move test results to [tests.md](./test_resources/tests.md)

</details>

<details>
<summary>2024/12/24</summary>

- add a new demo environment `bipedal_walker`

</details>

<details>
<summary>2024/12/23</summary>

- divide main and deploy branches, deploy branch should be used with a custom rsl_rl(which will be open-source soon)

</details>

## 🌟 Features

- **Totally based on [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym)**
  
  It's easy to use for those who are familiar with legged_gym and rsl_rl

- **Faster and Smaller**
  
  For a go2 walking on the plane task with 4096 envs, the training speed in Genesis is approximately **1.3x** compared to [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), while the graphics memory usage is roughly **1/2** compared to IsaacGym.

  With this smaller memory usage, it's possible to **run more parallel environments**, which can further improve the training speed.

## 🧪 Test Results

For tests conducted on Genesis, please refer to [tests.md](./test_resources/tests.md)

## 🛠 Installation

1. Create a new python virtual env with python>=3.10
2. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
3. Install Genesis following the instructions in the [Genesis repo](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis)
4. Install rsl_rl and tensorboard
   ```bash
   # Install rsl_rl.
   git clone git@github.com:leggedrobotics/rsl_rl.git
   cd rsl_rl && git checkout v1.0.2 && pip install -e . --use-pep517

   # Install tensorboard.
   pip install tensorboard
   ```
5. Install genesis_lr
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lupinjia/genesis_lr.git
   cd genesis_lr
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 👋 Usage

### 🚀 Quick Start

By default, the task is set to `go2`(in `utils/helpers.py`), we can run a training session with the following command:

```bash
cd legged_gym/scripts
python train.py --headless # run training without rendering
```

After the training is done, paste the `run_name` under `logs/go2` to `load_run` in `go2_config.py`: 

![](./test_resources/paste_load_run.png)

Then, run `play.py` to visualize the trained model:

![](./test_resources/go2_flat_play.gif)

### Mini Pupper Maze Example

To train the maze navigation policy with image observations:

```bash
python train.py --env minipupper_maze_env --headless --timesteps 50000
```

This uses PPO with a CNN policy on the 64x64 RGB camera stream.

## TODO

- [x] Add domain randomization
- [x] Verify the trained model on real robots.
- [x] Add Heightfield support
- [x] Add meausre_heights support
- [ ] Add go2 deploy demos and instructions (vanilla and explicit estimator)
- [ ] Add teacher-student implementation
